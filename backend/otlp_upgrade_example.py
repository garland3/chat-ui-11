Example: Upgrading to Dedicated OpenTelemetry Server

This example shows how easy it is to upgrade from file-based logging 
to a dedicated OpenTelemetry server.

To enable OTLP export to a dedicated server, simply uncomment the lines
in otel_config.py marked with "# In the future" and configure the endpoint.

    # OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint
